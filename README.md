Trust Finance 

Inspiration

  Our inspiration was to create a place for people to easily create their ideal portfolio.

What it does

  Our website shows users what a few options to invest and our backend work can allow users to create their own index fund based on user-inputted             parameters and offers a hybrid of two quantitative strategies for them as well. We also back-tested our strategy separately to prove its effectiveness.

How we built it

  We coded out our investing strategies in python and created the website with bootcamp. We use an API called IEX to pull market data to use. We used a       separate website called trendspider to backtest the strategy with 120 companies over the past 2 years.

Challenges we ran into

  Unfortunately, we didn't have to capability to actually connect our algorithm with a broker, so the algorithm cannot be completed without that step. This   is also why we had to backtest on a separate site. We also had issues fully integrating our python code into the site. Given more time we would have       liked to have our index fund solution completely run through the website and work with a broker to make both strategies work automatically.

What we learned

  We went into this with very little knowledge on our project. We had to completely learn everything about the API and coding trading algorithms with         python.

What's next for Trust Finance
  
  Increased functionality, completely integrating our formulas into the website, connection with a brokerage, and coding out our quantative trading           algorithim into python.

The project makes use of external APIs:
1. IEX Cloud api (financial data)
